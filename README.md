# AVL-Tree
Made Fall 2021

This was a project for my data structures & algorithms class. To understand the mechanisms of self-balancing binary search trees, we implemented our own-- specifically, an AVL tree.\
The tree is designed to be a container for student IDs. As such, each node can only contain an alphabetical name and an 8-digit ID number, or the insertion will be unsuccessful.

If you'd like to run this for yourself, run the "make" command in the root directory (need to have GNU's C++ compiler installed.)
