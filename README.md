# AVL-Tree
Made Fall 2021

This was a project for my data structures & algorithms class. To understand the mechanisms of self-balancing binary search trees, we implemented our own-- specifically, an AVL tree.
This tree is designed to be a container for student IDs. As such, each node can only contain an alphabetical name and an 8-digit ID number, or the insertion will be unsuccessful.\
